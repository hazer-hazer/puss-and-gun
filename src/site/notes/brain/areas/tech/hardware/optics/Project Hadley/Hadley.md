This is not my project but a story of how I built [Hadley Telescope](https://www.printables.com/model/224383-astronomical-telescope-hadley-an-easy-assembly-hig).

## Intro
I was possessed by the idea of buying a telescope for a little time now, after reading Reddit a lot and all these comments in which no budget scope is recommended (by budget I mean less than ~$300), but rather one should just use a pair of binoculars or monocular. I could hardly wait so bought [Svbony SV28](https://www.svbony.com/svbony-sv28-spotting-scope/#F9308P-W9177A-W2546A) monocular, which is a spotting scope with aperture of 70 and magnification from 25x to 75x. It gave me sufficient results, so I avoided first time disappointment. Also after diving into stargazing events, I found out that there will appear the supermoon the time I'll be in Turkey in the sea, so it was the best time to start. At the maximum magnification of 75x the moon didn't even fit into the FOV of my scope, I could see craters pretty well, but it was hard to observe anything because I was on the yacht. I did even see the Jupiter and its moons!

## Why I started this
My first thoughts about DIY telescopes were such that it is for astronomy nerds and requires buying expensive optics. Before the moment I found Hadley, where spherical lens is used which can be purchased on AliExpress for about $25, basic eyepieces are not that expensive too, and mostly all other details are 3D-printed or bought in household goods store. Many people say that buying scope will be cheaper than building one, but I don't think that this is the case for my country. 
The most expensive details: mirror set ($25) + two cheap eyepieces (~$30) + filament and some hardware (about $20) is much cheaper than any entry level scope I have seen being recommended. So I would like to challenge this to fit into $100 budget.
